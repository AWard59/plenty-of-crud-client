# Plenty of CRUD

Plenty of CRUD is a dating app that allows users to create multiple profiles and browse other profiles. Users can 'like' other profiles and potentially match with them. Matched profiles are stored for viewing.

## Planning Story

I began planning the project with wireframes and user stories. I already had an idea of how I wanted the application to look and function. I planned the application as a 'mobile-first' application since that is typically where such apps are used most.

As I was building a Single Page Application (SPA), I roughly planned out each 'page' in an HTML section and then worked through them one by one. After creating the models for the back-end, I implemented sign in/up functionality on the front-end and integrated it with API calls to the back-end routes.

Once the basic CRUD commands were created and functional, I worked on one feature at a time, both on the frontend and backend, and committed the changes when each feature was complete.

I have bigger plans for this project, and it will continue to be improved, starting with the listed features below.
